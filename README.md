# 'Zero Deforestation Mission' Hackatron NIWE
![Portada](https://github.com/75Engel/Deforestation/blob/main/Images/Repo/Imagen%20para%20repo.jpg)
===
## Introduction:

Repository for a Hackatron on 19 November, powered by **[NUWE.io]**(https://nuwe.io/) and organized by **General Electric Europe**.

The objetive of this Hackatron was predict from some given images what type of deforestation shows.

The given files are not in this repository. There are 3 files to download (train.csv, test.csv and a compressed file with the images).
---
This **repository** contains:

> folder of notebook

> folder  or datas

> folder of Images

> readme file

> 2 submissions files (one loaded as .json and another loaded as .csv)

> presentation file to explain the project

> main as .py o .ipynb (in this case I called it notebook_1)

## Explain:

For this Hackatron I decided to test how good I can work with a **Neural Convolutional  Network**. 

First: I took a look for the quality of train datas. 

In this situation I looked for duplicates situations and how balanced was the *target feature*.

Second: I prepared the *Neural Network*.

This Neural Network had 8 layers.

Third: I predicted target for test datas and saved in a *.csv* file and *.json* file.

I didn't work enough time in my training with this kind of prediction models so I made the decision to try it in this Hackatron.

The result is not quite good, because I only had time to prepare 1 model and this kind of Neural Network spend too much time.

## To improve:

These points are related to files to submit:

> Time to prepare presentation, search of information about the thema.
>
> Time to get a better analysis and visualization.

This point is related to improve results:

> Get a better knowledge for predicting models
> 

Sure, I will have much to improve, bit this is just the beginning.
